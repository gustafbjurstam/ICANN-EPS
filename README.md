# EPS-ICANN: Data-driven constitutive modelling of EPS foams

This repository contains the code and data associated with the MSc thesis  
**“Data-driven Constitutive Modelling of Expanded Polystyrene Foams”** (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, 2025).

## Thesis
The full thesis is published and available through the KTH DiVA portal:  
[Thesis PDF on DiVA][diva-link]

## Code
The repository contains the implementation of data-driven constitutive models using the Constitutive Artificial Neural Network (CANN) and its inelastic extension (iCANN).  

Key features:
- Polyconvex energy function for elasticity  
- Predictor–corrector formulation with co-rotated intermediate configuration for plasticity  
- Support for uniaxial, biaxial, and shear data  
- Training with staged optimisation and regularisation for stability and sparsity
